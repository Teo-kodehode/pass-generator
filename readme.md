## DO NOT USE THIS AS AN ACTUAL PASSWORD GENERATOR
This is just a simple generator using math that is not completely random, i would NOT recommend using this as an actual password generator.
The project was made entirely to test my skills and should not be used as for safety reasons.

Any tips on how to clean or simplify the JS code would be greatly appriciated.

The part where i struggled the most was to get the 4 passwords to be different from each other, i came up with a working solution, but it is a bit to crude and manual in my opinion
